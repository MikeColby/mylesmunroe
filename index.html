        <center>Dr. Myles Munroe has been an inspirational force and a great leadership mentor to a lot of people across the globe including great world leaders, head of states and I am happy i am also admiring him. I really admire him a lot because of his determined, dedication and God-fearing nature to help shape the concept about God and his Kingdom on earth and how to live a life of purpose on earth.</center>
        <br><center>This is his explanation about purpose, vision and it really got me, he said<i><strong> “Purpose is when you know and understand what you were born to accomplish. Vision is when you see it in your mind and begin to imagine it.”</i></strong></center><br>
        <center>In one of his teachings he said <i><strong> “The greatest tragedy in life is not death, but a life without a purpose.”.</i></strong> Indeed he is a great man who was on a journey on purpose, it is sad that he is no more but he left a great legacy which speaks in his absence and i encourage everyone to pay attention to his messages and trust me you will get back on track living a life with purpose.</center>
